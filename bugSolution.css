Instead of relying on percentages within `calc()` in nested elements, consider using fixed pixel values or a different approach to achieve the desired layout.  In this example, refactoring the CSS to use explicit pixel values for inner elements solved the unexpected behavior.  You might also consider using flexbox or grid layout for more predictable and robust layouts.
